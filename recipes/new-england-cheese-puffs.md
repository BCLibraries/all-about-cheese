### New England Cheese Puffs

* 1 cup sifted flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ½ teaspoon Hungarian paprika
* ¼ teaspoon dry moustard
* 2 egg yolks, beaten lemon-yellow
* ½ cup milk
* 1 cup freshly grated Cheddar cheese
* 2 egg whites, beaten stiff but not dry

Sift dry ingredients together, mix yolks with milk and stir in. Add cheese and when thoroughly incorporated fold in the egg whites to make a smooth batter. Drop from a big spoon into hot deep fat and cook until well browned.

Caraway seeds are sometimes added. Poppy seeds are also used, and either of these makes a snappier puff, especially tasty when served with soup.

A few drops of tabasco give this an extra tang.
