### Pizza—The Tomato Pie of Sicily

#### Dough

1 package yeast, dissolved in warm water
2 cups sifted flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil

Make dough of this. Knead 12 to 20 minutes. Pat into a ball, cover it tight and let stand 3 hours in warm place until twice the size.

#### Tomato paste

* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 large onions, sliced thin
* 1 can Italian tomato paste
* ½ teaspoon oregano
* Salt
* Crushed chili pepper
* 2½ cups water


In the oil fry onion tender but not too brown, stir in tomato paste and keep stirring 3 or 4 minutes. Season, pour water over and simmer slowly 25 to 30 minutes.

#### Cheese

½ cup grated Italian, Parmesan, Swiss or Cheddar, depending on your pocketbook

Procure a low, wide and handsome tin pizza pan, or reasonable substitute, and grease well before spreading the well-raised dough ½ to ¾ inch thick. Poke your finger tips haphazardly into the dough to make marks that will catch the sauce when you pour it on generously. Shake on Parmesan or Parmesan-type cheese and bake in hot oven ½ hour, then ¼ hour more at lower heat until the pizza is golden-brown. Cut in wedges like any other pie and serve.
