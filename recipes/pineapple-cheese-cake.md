### Pineapple Cheese Cake

* 2½ pounds sieved pot cheese
* 1-inch piece vanilla bean
* ¼ pound sweet butter, melted
* ½ small box graham crackers, crushed fine
* 4 eggs
* 2 cups sugar
* 6 cherries
* 1 small can crushed pineapple, drained
* 2 cups milk
* ⅓ cup flour

In a big bowl mix everything except the graham crackers and pineapple in the order given above. Butter a square Pyrex pan and put in the graham-cracker dust to make,a crust. Cover this evenly with the pineapple and pour in the cheese-custard mixture. Bake I hour in a "quiet" oven, as the English used to say for a moderate one, and when done set aside for 12 hours before eating.
