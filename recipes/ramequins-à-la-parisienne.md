### Ramequins a la Parisienne

* 2 cups milk
* 1 cup cream
* 1 ounce salt butter
* 1 tablespoon flour
* ½ cup grated Gruyere
* Coarsely ground pepper
* An atom of nutmeg
* A soupçon of garlic
* A light touch of powdered sugar
* 8 eggs, separated

Boil milk and cream together. Melt butter, mix in the flour and stir over heat 5 minutes, adding the milk and cream mixture a little at a time. When thoroughly cooked, remove from heat and stir in cheese, seasonings and the yolks of all 8 eggs, well beaten, and the whites of 2 even better beaten. When well mixed, fold in the remaining egg whites, stiffly beaten, until you have a batter as smooth and thick as cream. Pour this into ramekins of paper, porcelain or earthenware, filling each about ⅔ full to allow for them to puff up as they bake in a very slow oven until golden-brown (or a little less than 20 minutes).
