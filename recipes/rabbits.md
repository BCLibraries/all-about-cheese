## Rabbits

### Curry Rabbit

* 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* 2 cups milk
* 2½ cups grated cheese
* 1 tablespoon minced chives
* 2 green onions, minced
* 2 shallots, minced
* ¼ teaspoon imported curry powder
* 1 tablespoon chutney sauce

Dissolve cornstarch in a little of the milk and scald the rest over hot water. Thicken with cornstarch mixture and stir in the cheese, chives, onions, shallots, curry and chutney while wooden-spooning steadily until smooth and sizzling enough to pour over buttered toast.

People who can't let well enough alone put cornstarch in Rabbits, just as they add soda to spoil the cooking of vegetables.

### Buttermilk Rabbit

Substitute buttermilk for plain milk in the No. 2 Rabbit. To be consistent, use fresh-cured Buttermilk Cheese, instead of the usual Cheddar of fresh cow's milk. This is milder.
